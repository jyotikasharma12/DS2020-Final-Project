# Analysis on Physical Characteristics of Penguins in the Palmer Archipelago

#### Jyotika Sharma, Selena Cooper, Grace Kolker

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to explore the Palmer Penguins dataset to
better understand the differences in physical traits between penguin
species. This dataset includes measurements collected on three penguins
species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap) living on multiple islands in
the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. By analyzing these physical
measurements, we hope to identify patterns, species differneces, and
relationships between body size variables. Understanding these traits
can help explain how environmental conditions and biological factors may
influence species variation and survival.

In pursuit of the stated goal, we will explore the following questions:

1.  How do body size measurements vary between penguin species? Are
    certain species consistently larger in one or more measurements such
    as body mass or flipper length? - Selena

2.  How do bill length and bill depth interact to help differentiate
    penguin species? Can these measurements be used to identify species
    differences effectively? - Selena

3.  Is there a relationship between flipper length and body mass across
    species? Do larger flippers indicate heavier penguins, and does this
    relationship differ by species? - Jyotika

4.  How does sex influence body size? Are male penguins consistently
    larger than female penguins across all species, and does this vary
    in strength across difference species? - Jyotika

5.  Does the island a penguins inhabits affect its body measurements?
    Are physical differences across islands still present even after
    accounting for species? - Grace

6.  Which variable (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, or body
    mass) provides the strongest prediction of species classification?
    How do combines variables compare to single-variable predication? -
    Grace

These are the main questions we intend to answer through analysis of the
Palmer Penguins dataset. With the findings, we will be able to draw
meaningful conclusions about physical trait differences and the
ecological factors that influence species variation in Antarctic
penguins.
